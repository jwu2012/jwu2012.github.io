Welcome to my homepage! I'm currently a 5th year PhD student from the department of [Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering](https://ise.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I'm fortunately advised by [Dr. Pingfeng Wang](https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/pingfeng). I will join Meta as a full time research scientist (machine learning) starting next January.

I obtained my master degree from the UIUC, and the bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

My research interest lies in:
- **Applied machine learning** with a focus on network systems, e.g. social networks, supply chain network and interconnected infrastructure systems
- **Discrete optimization** based decision making framework for interconnected infrastructures, such as optimal configuration or recovery through external disturbances
